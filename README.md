# Lemmings for 3DS

Setup:
Copy the required* files into the following subfolders of /lemmings folder:
orig\_demo, orig, ohno\_demo, ohno, xmas91, xmas92, holi93\_demo, holi93, holi94\_demo and/or holi94. You need to fill at least one folder to play the game.
To avoid duplicates, you may only fill these folders if you own all Lemmings games:
orig, ohno, xmas91, xmas92, holi94

The game uses the NDSP service to play audio. Thus you need a DSP firm dump to have audio.
You may want to use your own sound files. Put your wave files into lemmings/audio folder.
See README.txt in that folder for more details.

\* See README.txt in these folders.

These files are not included (and will never be included),
because they are protected by copyright law.

For game control, see CONTROL.txt.
